<h1>From the desk of Treasurer Maria Pappas</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Cambria",serif'>Academic and government studies often make media waves, then
end up collecting dust.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Cambria",serif'>That&#8217;s not the case when it comes to my Research
Team&#8217;s two major studies from 2022.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Cambria",serif'>Both studies &#8212; one on the failure of the Scavenger Sale
to return decaying and abandoned properties to productive use, the other on how
wealthy investors exploit property tax loopholes to drain millions of dollars a
year from minority communities &#8212; led to my proposed Property Tax Equity
Legislation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Cambria",serif'>The legislation, now a collaboration between the
Treasurer&#8217;s Office and the Chicago Community Trust, advanced last week in
the Illinois House, where it appears to have strong support. Rep. Kam Buckner,
D-Chicago, is the sponsor of that measure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Cambria",serif'>If it passes in the House, the bill will move to the Senate, where
Sen. Ram Villivalam, also a Chicago Democrat, is shepherding the measure. If
enacted, the bill will:</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:Symbol'>&middot;<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Cambria",serif'>Close
loopholes that have allowed tax buyers &#8212; mostly hedge funds and private
equity firms &#8212; to drain about $40 million each year from governments
serving mostly Black and Latino residents.</span></p>


<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:Symbol'>&middot;<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Cambria",serif'>Cut
in half the interest rate charged by Cook County on delinquent property tax
bills &#8212; from 18% annually to 9% annually. That will save late taxpayers
between $25 million and $35 million a year, with most of those savings
occurring in Black and Latino households.</span></p>


<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:Symbol'>&middot;<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Cambria",serif'>Permit
Cook County to stop holding Scavenger Sales and use new tools to put chronically
tax delinquent properties more efficiently into the hands of municipalities,
local developers and non-profit so the properties may be rehabilitated.</span></p>


<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Cambria",serif'>My office recommended closing of property tax loopholes in
&#8220;</span><a href="https://www.cookcountytreasurer.com/siestudylinks.aspx"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Cambria",serif'>How
Wealthy Investors are Making Millions Exploiting Illinois&#8217; Property Tax
Law</span></a><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Cambria",serif'>,&#8221;
which I published in October 2022.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Cambria",serif'>Those loopholes exist in an esoteric section of the state&#8217;s
property tax code, known as sales in error. Current law allows tax buyers to back
out of deals and get all of their money back &#8212; frequently with
government-paid interest. The study noted tax buyers over the years helped
craft the sales-in-error legislation to favor themselves over property owners.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Cambria",serif'>As a result, tax buyers in Cook County have received refunds totaling
about $277.6 million, including at least $27.7 million in interest, during a
seven-year period ending in September 2022. Of the money refunded, about 87%
was siphoned from local governments serving predominantly Black and Latino
residents &#8212; making it even tougher for fiscally challenged communities to
deliver basic services such as education and public safety.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Cambria",serif'>Tax buyers scored refunds, for minor errors that would not be
allowed in other states, the study found. For example, refunds were issued for
a suburban shopping mall because the assessor listed it as having zero square
feet; properties listed as not having air conditioning when they did; and a
legal notice that misstated how much was owed by a mere 3 cents.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Cambria",serif'>The legislation would make it more difficult for tax buyers to
get sales in error for such insignificant reasons. It also would change
procedures to ensure property owners are notified of their rights within the
required period; eliminate the interest paid to tax buyers in most
sale-in-error cases; and create rules to prevent repeat sales in error on the
same property.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Cambria",serif'>The proposed interest rate reduction and shift away from the
Scavenger Sales were recommended in &#8220;</span><a

style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Cambria",serif'>Maps of
Inequality: From Redlining to Urban Decay and the Black Exodus</span></a><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Cambria",serif'>,&#8221;
which I published in July 2022.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Cambria",serif'>Maps of Inequality noted the Scavenger Sale was created not
long after the federal government sanctioned redlining in the late 1930s and
found a correlation between redlining &#8212; the practice of discouraging
mortgage lending in minority areas &#8212; and large swaths of vacant and abandoned
land on Chicago&#8217;s South and West sides and in the south suburbs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Cambria",serif'>The study found that the decades-old Scavenger Sale &#8212; a
last-ditch auction of chronically delinquent properties so they could be
restored to productive use &#8212; was failing at its mission.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Cambria",serif'>The legislation would allow the county to take vacant and
abandoned properties, clear them of municipal and mechanics liens and put them
in the hands of people and organizations that agree to develop them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Cambria",serif'>The goals of my Property Tax Equity legislation are to restore
some measure of wealth to minority communities, aid struggling governments that
serve Black and Latino residents and start to reverse the urban decay that
plagues so many areas of the county.</span></p>
