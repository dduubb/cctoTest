        <h1>Countywide Property Tax Collection Rate Shrouds South Suburban Financial Woes</h1>
        <p>Editor’s Note: This is the first in a series of periodic analyses,  observations and insights into Cook County’s property tax system in a  newsletter format produced by Treasurer Maria Pappas’ Office.</p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The historically high rate of property tax collections in  Cook County held steady into 2023, but that overall high collection rate masks  a little-known fact: collections in many economically struggling, mostly  minority south suburbs are perilously low.<p class="pp-brake">
            Those collection rates, registering below 52% in four  suburbs, make it tough for schools, municipalities and other government  agencies to provide basic services. For example, in Ford Heights — where the  collection rate was 29% compared to the countywide rate of 96% — has not been  able to afford a police department for years.<p class="pp-brake">
            The lack of collections in those communities also creates  pressure for public officials to increase the amounts they ask for, which can  push some of the highest tax rates in the nation to even more stratospheric levels.<p class="pp-brake">
            Another key finding after examining collections for bills  mailed last year 25 days after they were due on Dec. 30: collection of property  taxes on vacant properties, many of which likely have been abandoned, stood  below 70%.</p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>The Treasurer&rsquo;s Office is charged with billing and  collecting property taxes for all local taxing districts in Cook County. For  the 2021 tax year, for which taxes are collected in 2022, those taxing bodies  sought a total of $16.7 billion in property taxes.<p class="pp-brake">
            Those bills, and the disparate impact they had on taxpayers  in different areas of the county, were
            <a href="https://www.cookcountytreasurer.com/taxbillanalysisandstatistics.aspx">analyzed  by the Treasurer&rsquo;s Office</a>
            in early December, when the second-installment bills  were mailed. Payment on those bills was due Dec. 31, 2022.<p class="pp-brake">
            .
            <p class="pp-brake">
            This analysis looks at how much of that money was collected  25 days after the bills were due and compared those collections to previous  years at the same point in the collection cycle.<p class="pp-brake">
            It&rsquo;s worth noting that past history indicates that  collections will continue to rise in coming months, particularly in the weeks  before the tax sale — which can over time result in the loss of one&rsquo;s property  — that is held about 13 months after the due date.</p>

        <h2>Countywide Overview</h2>
        <p>As of January  25, 2023, Cook County had collected an estimated  95.9% of property  taxes billed for tax year 2021, which were due on December 31, 2022.<p class="pp-brake">
            The 2021 tax bill collection rate is in line with those of  prior years. Collection rates 25 days after the second-installment tax bills were due in the previous  four years were all between  95% and 96% (Table 1).</p>

        <p>Table 1:  Collection Rates 25 days after the second installment of property taxes were  due in tax years 2017 to 2021. Collection rates are estimates based on the  amount of tax dollars paid with refunds subtracted.<p class="pp-brake">
            As noted above, collection rates usually increase in the  months and years after the bills are due, as delinquent taxes are paid or  eventually sold at tax sales. The collection rates for prior years to date  currently stand at 98% to  99% countywide.
        </p>
        <p>The 25-day collection rates reflect the amount of money  collected for each taxing district in the county, minus the amount refunded for  various reasons, including bounced checks, duplicate payments and overpayments.The  tax year 2021 collection rates for most types of property, including commercial  and industrial properties, apartment buildings, condominiums and single-family  homes, were 95% or higher. The major exception was vacant land, on which only  71% of the money billed had been collected 70% (Table 2).<p class="pp-brake">
            Historically, vacant land has had a much higher likelihood  of becoming tax delinquent and being offered at the Annual Tax Sale or the  last-ditch Scavenger Sale for chronically deqlinquent properties. About 63% of properties offered  at the 2022  Scavenger Sale were vacant  lots, even though vacant lots account for only 3.6% of the county&rsquo;s taxable properties,  according to a
            <a href="https://www.cookcountytreasurer.com/scavengersalestudymapsofinequality.aspx">Treasurer&rsquo;s  Office study</a>.<p class="pp-brake">
            Countywide, commercial and industrial collections have  slightly lower collection  rates than residential and multi-family properties. Incentive properties  — which pay taxes on a lower percentage of their assessed values —  have higher collection rates than non-incentive properties.

            South s uburban municipalities  have the lowest collection rates  .  For  the 2021 tax year, Harvey, Robbins, and Phoenix  collected between 59.7% and 51.8%  of what they billed (Table 4). Ford  Heights has by far the county&rsquo;s lowest collection rate  — an  alarming 29.1%.
            <p class="pp-brake">
            These  collection rates are driven down by the high amount of chronically vacant and  abandoned properties in these communities. In Harvey, the collection rate on  vacant lots is 27.8%, and  in Ford Heights it is 6.1%.</p>

            Most municipalities have had similar collection rates  for the most recent five tax years, with  those rates fluctuating by fewer than 3 percentage  points .

            Municipalities with low collection rates struggle to  maintain basic local services. In Robbins, a village of 4,600, there were

        </h2>
        <p>The collection rate in Chicago is slightly higher than the  countywide rate at 96.4%,  but  as in  suburban Cook County, collection rates vary greatly  from  one area of the city to another. Collection  rates among  community  areas   varied  from 74.6% to 98.3%.
            <p class="pp-brake">
            The  highest collection rates mostly were  in or near downtown and on   the N orth and No rthwest  sides (Table 5). The exceptions were in Mount Greenwood on the far  southwest side and Pullman on the far South Side.</p>

        <p>Table 6:  Chicago Community Areas with the lowest tax year 2021 collection rates, as of  January 25, 2023<p class="pp-brake">
            While various community areas struggle to pay property  taxes, the  city of Chicago&rsquo;s  overll collection rate is still high, so these communities are not  in a precarious financial situation like low-income municipalities. Still, high  delinquency rates cause a myriad of issues within these community areas,  including a high number of properties being offered at tax and scavenger sales  and high rates of abandonment.
            <p class="pp-brake">
            The chronic delinquency in southern Cook County and Chicago&rsquo;s  South and West sides is tied to a long history of racism, segregation and  disinvestment in the Chicago area, explored in the office&rsquo;s 2022 study &ldquo;<a href="https://www.cookcountytreasurer.com/pdfs/scavengersalestudy/2022scavengersalestudy.pdf">Maps  of Inequality: From Redlining to Urban Decay and the Black Exodus</a>.&rdquo;</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Tax collections for tax year 2021 are steady countywide, but  in municipalities with concentrated poverty, abandoned properties, and tax  delinquency, collection rates are concerningly low. [DO WE HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS  OR POSSIBLE POLICY PLUGS?]<p class="pp-brake">
