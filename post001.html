    <pp-div><h1>High Countywide Property  Tax Collection Rate Shrouds South Suburban Financial Woes</h1>
<p><em>Note: This is the first periodic newsletter from the  Research Team in Cook County Treasurer Maria Pappas&rsquo; office. The newsletters  will provide analyses, observations and insights into Cook County&rsquo;s property  tax system.</em></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The historically high rate of property tax collections in  Cook County held steady into 2023, but that overall high collection rate masks  a little-known fact: collections in many economically struggling, mostly  minority south suburbs are perilously low.</p>
  <p>Those collection rates, which were below 53% in four  suburbs, make it tough for schools, municipalities and other government  agencies to provide basic services. For example, in Ford Heights — where the  collection rate was 29.3% compared to the countywide rate of 96.0% — has not  been able to afford a police force for years.</p>
  <p>The inability to collect taxes owed to those communities  also creates pressure on public officials to further increase taxes, which can  push some of the highest tax rates in the nation to even more stratospheric levels.</p>
  <p>Another key finding from the Treasurer&rsquo;s Office&rsquo;s  examination of collections for bills mailed last year that were due Dec. 30:  collection of property taxes on vacant properties, many of which likely have  been abandoned, stood below 71%.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The Treasurer&rsquo;s Office bills and collects property taxes for  all local taxing districts in Cook County. For the 2021 tax year, which were  billed in 2022, those taxing districts sought a total of $16.7 billion in  property taxes.</p>
  <p>Those bills, and the uneven impact they had on taxpayers in  different areas of the county, were <a href="https://www.cookcountytreasurer.com/taxbillanalysisandstatistics.aspx">analyzed  by the Treasurer&rsquo;s Office</a> in early December, when the second installment bills  were mailed. Payments were due Dec. 30, 2022.</p>
  <p>This analysis looked at how much money was collected 25 days  after bills were due and compared those collections to previous years&rsquo;  collections at the same point in the collection cycle.</p>
  <p>Historical trends indicate collections will continue to rise  in coming months, particularly in the weeks before the Annual Tax Sale, which  can over time result in the loss of one&rsquo;s property. That sale is held about 13  months after the due date.</p>

<h2>Countywide Overview</h2>
<p>As of Jan. 25, 2023, Cook County had collected 96.0% of  property taxes billed for tax year 2021, which were due on Dec. 30, 2022.</p>
  <p>The 2021 collection rate is in line with those of prior years.  Collection rates 25 days after the second-installment tax bills were due in the  previous four years were all between 95% and 96% (Table 1).</p>

<p class="caption">Table 1:  Collection Rates 25 days after the second installment of property taxes were  due in tax years 2017 to 2021. Collection rates are estimates based on the  amount of tax dollars paid with refunds subtracted.</p>
  <p>As noted above, collection rates usually increase in the  months and years after the bills are due, as delinquent taxes are paid or  eventually sold at tax sales. The collection rates for prior years to date  currently stand at 98% to 99% countywide. </p>
  <p>The 25-day collection rates reflect the amount of money  collected for each taxing district in the county, minus the amount refunded for  various reasons, including bounced checks, duplicate payments and overpayments.</p>
  <p>Tax year 2021 collection rates for most types of property,  including commercial and industrial properties, apartment buildings,  condominiums and single-family homes, were 95% or higher. The exception was  vacant land, on which only 70.7% of the money billed had been collected (Table  2).</p>
  <p>Vacant land has had a higher likelihood of becoming tax  delinquent and being offered at the Annual Tax Sale or the last-ditch Scavenger  Sale for chronically delinquent properties. About 63% of properties offered at  the 2022  Scavenger Sale were vacant  lots, even though vacant lots account for only 3.6% of the county&rsquo;s taxable  properties, according to a <a href="https://www.cookcountytreasurer.com/scavengersalestudymapsofinequality.aspx">Treasurer&rsquo;s  Office study</a>.</p>
  <p>Commercial and industrial properties have slightly lower collection  rates than residential and multi-family properties. Incentive properties — which  pay taxes on a lower percentage of their assessed values — have higher  collection rates than non-incentive properties. </p>

  <p>The south suburbs have the lowest collection rates. For the  2021 tax year, Harvey, Robbins, and Phoenix have collected between 49.9% and 52.1%  of what they billed (Table 4). Ford Heights has by far the county&rsquo;s lowest  collection rate — an alarming 29.3%.</p>
  <p>These rates are driven down by the high amount of vacant and  abandoned properties. Ford Heights has the highest share of vacant lots in the  county, at 47.1% of taxable properties, followed by Robbins at 37.5% and Dixmoor  at 30.6%. In Harvey, the collection rate on vacant lots is 27.9%, and in Ford  Heights it is 6.1%. </p>
  <p>The treasurer&rsquo;s office has found a correlation between share  of vacant lots and low collection rates – in general, collection rates are  lower in communities with high amounts of vacant land.</p>

<p class="caption">Table 4:  The municipalities with the lowest collection rates in tax year 2021, as of Jan.  25, 2023</p>
  <p>*<em>For municipalities that are in multiple counties, only  the parts of the municipalities that are in Cook County were analyzed.  Municipalities with fewer than 500 properties in the county were omitted</em></p>
  <p>Most municipalities have had similar collection rates for  the most recent five tax years, with those rates fluctuating by fewer than 3  percentage points. The two outliers include Dixmoor, which has seen collection  rates increase from an estimated 66.6% to 78.2% since 2017, and Ford Heights,  which has had its collection rate fall by 9.1%.</p>
  <p>Municipalities with low collection rates struggle to provide  basic services. In Robbins, a village of 4,600, there were <a href="https://news.wttw.com/2022/12/01/chicago-tonight-your-neighborhood-robbins-calls-federal-help-fix-aging-water">23  water main breaks in 2022</a>. Robbins Mayor Darren Bryant sought state and federal aid, saying:  &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t wrongfully neglected our infrastructure. We just never have had the  money to repair it.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Government leaders in Harvey, the most populous city in Cook  County with a collection rate below 80%, <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/harvey-il-news-police/3322684/">laid off  firefighters</a> to make required payments to its public safety pension fund.</p>
  <p>Decreased collections, and the stress they place on school  districts, municipalities and other local governments, can put pressure on local  leaders to vote for even higher levies — the amount of money they seek to collect  from property taxes each year. Higher levies, in turn, lead to higher tax  rates.</p>
  <p>Further increases in tax rates in many south suburbs would  worsen the outsized burden already placed on property owners in those towns.</p>
  <p>A sign of that burden: The three municipalities with the  highest tax rates in Cook County are all in the south suburbs, <a href="https://www.cookcountyclerkil.gov/sites/default/files/pdfs/2021%20Tax%20Rate%20Report.pdf">according  to the Cook County Clerk&rsquo;s Office</a>. Park Forest has the highest composite  tax rate at 41.6% of assessed values, followed by Riverdale at 31.1% and  Phoenix at 30%. For comparison, the city of Chicago&rsquo;s composite tax rate is  6.7% (Figure 3).</p>
<p>Collections in unincorporated areas are close to the  countywide rate of 96.0%. </p>

<h2>Chicago Community Areas</h2>
<p>The collection rate in Chicago is slightly higher than the  countywide rate of 96.5%, but as in suburban Cook County, rates vary from one  area of the city to another. Collection rates among community areas varied from  74.6% to 98.6%. </p>
  <p>The highest collection rates mostly were in or near downtown  and on the North and Northwest sides (Table 5). The exceptions were in Mount  Greenwood on the far southwest side and Pullman on the far South Side.</p>

<p class="caption">Table 6:  Chicago Community Areas with the lowest tax year 2021 collection rates, as of  Jan. 25, 2023</p>
  <p>While property owners in some community areas struggle to  pay their property taxes, the city&rsquo;s overall collection rate is still high, so  these communities are not in a precarious financial situation like low-income  municipalities. Still, high delinquency rates are reflective of high rates of  vacancy and abandonment and the struggles faced by those areas&rsquo; low-income  residents. </p>
  <p>The chronic delinquency in southern Cook County and  Chicago&rsquo;s South and West sides is tied to a history of racism, segregation and  disinvestment in the Chicago area, explored in the office&rsquo;s 2022 study &ldquo;<a href="https://www.cookcountytreasurer.com/pdfs/scavengersalestudy/2022scavengersalestudy.pdf">Maps  of Inequality: From Redlining to Urban Decay and the Black Exodus</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>High overall property tax collection rates in Cook County  mask persistently low collection rates in south suburban municipalities and  west suburban Maywood that severely limit their ability to provide basic  services to mostly minority, low-income residents — revealing yet another inequity  in the property tax system.</p>
  <p>That means there&rsquo;s less money for education, public safety  and other vital services. Much of the problem is fueled by wide swaths of tax-delinquent  vacant and abandoned land.</p>
  <p>Public policy makers should step up efforts to return vacant  and abandoned properties to productive use and consider finding other funding  mechanisms for schools and local governments.</p>
