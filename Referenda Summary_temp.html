<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>In Illinois, &nbsp;referendums are designed to give voters the
final say over local governments’ power to tax and spend beyond state-imposed
limits.. But low voter turnout &nbsp;means that a distinct minority of voters typically
make those crucial decisions. a new Cook County Treasurer’s Office
analysis found.</p>

<p>The Treasurer’s Office examined 75 property
tax-related referendums<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span class="footnote-reference"><span class="footnote-reference"><span>[1]</span></span></span></a>
&nbsp;held in Cook County elections from 2020 to 2023.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span class="footnote-reference"><span class="footnote-reference"><span>[2]</span></span></span></a>
While more than seven in 10 passed, average voter turnout was a low 32% —
ranging from just 4% to 74%.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><span class="footnote-reference"><span class="footnote-reference"><span>[3]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p>Those who did vote decided whether to increase taxes, issue
new debt, create or dissolve taxing districts, and grant or eliminate powers
that allow their municipal governments to enact a broader array of taxes. The referendums
that passed allowed local governments to:</p>

<p class="gappy-list list-bullet"><span>
</span>Proceed with 27 bond issues that created $1.16 billion in new
debt</p>

<p class="gappy-list list-bullet"><span>
</span>Exceed limits on tax levy increases by more than $58 million</p>

<p class="gappy-list list-bullet"><span>
</span>Increase tax levies by $5.2 million above state limits to pay off
existing bond debt</p>

<p class="gappy-list list-bullet"><span>
</span>Adopt home rule powers — which give municipal officials
greater power to impose taxes, including the authority to exceed limits on
property tax levy increases — in three suburbs</p>

<p>Referendums passed at the highest rate — more than 83%
— in even-year primary elections. Primaries &nbsp;tend to attract voters
who are focused on national, state and partisan issues and may not be well
versed on local issues or specifics of the referendums on the ballot. An
average of about one in four registered voters weighed in on referendums
during&nbsp; primaries, when voters approved 17 of 18 proposed bond issues and tax
increases, while rejecting home rule powers in three out of five cases.</p>

<p>The next-highest &nbsp;rate at which voters approved referendums
— about 68% — was in even-year general elections, in which voters
pick national and state leaders. These elections draw higher turnout, with
nearly half of the voters weighing in on referendums.&nbsp; Voters &nbsp;in
these elections &nbsp;&nbsp;might not be familiar with local issues.</p>

<p>Voters were least likely to back referendums in consolidated
elections — with a passage rate of about 61%. — <a name="_GoBack"></a>when
&nbsp;people are voting &nbsp;solely on local issues and are likely more attuned
to local politics. Less than one in five registered voters weighed in on referendums
in &nbsp;consolidated elections.</p>

<p>Whether a referendum succeeds depends on many factors,
including turnout, the nature of the question posed, the ability of referendum supporters
&nbsp;to get their voters to the polls and where the &nbsp;question is placed on
the ballot. Those factors limit the ability to draw broad conclusions about referendums
and voters .</p>

<p>Still, it is clear that a minority of all registered voters &nbsp;decides
a referendum’s fate &nbsp;Only 12% of referendums &nbsp;in the past four
years drew more than 50% of voters to the polls, while 47% of the referendums
saw less than 25% of voters weigh in.</p>

<p>That may be something for people &nbsp;to ponder, given that
at the time of this analysis, the March 2024 primary election is near. Suburban
Chicago &nbsp;voters &nbsp;are to consider &nbsp;13 referendums that allow five
bond issues totaling $152.3 million, four tax rate increases that &nbsp;exceed limits
by a total of more than $8.6 million, &nbsp;two smaller suburbs to &nbsp;adopt
powers that give them more taxing authority, creation of a new mental health
district with taxing powers and one to dissolve a northwest suburban fire
protection district that <a href="https://www.journal-topics.com/articles/elk-grove-township-fire-dept-abruptly-ends-operations/">stopped
operating in October 2023</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, Chicago is asking voters to decide whether to
enact <a href="https://www.wbez.org/stories/what-the-bring-chicago-home-referendum-would-do/7b3784c7-7099-42a6-b3fb-f8abc4f81448">significantly
higher real estate transfer taxes</a><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><span class="footnote-reference"><span class="footnote-reference"><span>[4]</span></span></span></a>
on properties that sell for $1 million, while lowering taxes on properties that
sell for less.</p>

<div class="section-1 section"><h1>Types of Referendums that Impact &nbsp;Property Taxes</h1>

<h2>Issue Property Tax-Backed Debt Above State Limits</h2>

<p>To issue general obligation bonds — which are backed
by property taxes &nbsp;— that exceed &nbsp;borrowing limits, school
districts, non-home rule cities and villages, park districts and other local governments
are required to seek voter approval through referendums.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><span class="footnote-reference"><span class="footnote-reference"><span>[5]</span></span></span></a>
Bonds are a form of long-term borrowing, akin to a home’s mortgage,
typically used by governments to pay for major projects with long-term benefits
that cannot be paid for with existing revenues.</p>

<p>During the time period analyzed, 34 referendums sought &nbsp;a
total of $1.3 billion in general obligation debt authorization. Of those, 27
passed &nbsp;for a success rate &nbsp;of 79%. As a result, local governments
issued $1.16 billion in bonds.</p>

<h2>Increase Limiting Rate</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://cms5.revize.com/revize/dupage/Supervisor%20of%20Assessments/Documents/Other%20Documents/PTAX1080.pdf">Property
Tax Extension Limitation Law</a>, known by its acronym PTELL, limits how much
government officials can raise taxes. PTELL restricts the overall amount of
property taxes levied by non-home rule taxing districts to no more than the
prior year’s increase in the Consumer Price Index, or 5%, whichever is
less.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><span class="footnote-reference"><span class="footnote-reference"><span>[6]</span></span></span></a>
Government officials can tax more than that if &nbsp;voters agree.</p>

<p>During the period studied, governments offered 15 referendums
&nbsp;to exceed the levy caps. Of those, 11 passed — a passing rate of 73%.
As a result, levy caps were exceeded by a total of $58 million in those 11
taxing districts.</p>

<h2>Exceed Limits for Increasing Property Taxes for non-Referendum Bond Payments</h2>

<p>Non-home rule governments may issue general obligation bonds
without seeking voter approval based on the value of district’s taxable
property.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><span class="footnote-reference"><span class="footnote-reference"><span>[7]</span></span></span></a>
Other types of bonds — including those used to refund other bonds, create
a working cash fund, and improve water or wastewater treatment facilities
— don’t require referendums.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><span class="footnote-reference"><span class="footnote-reference"><span>[8]</span></span></span></a>
Under <a href="https://cms5.revize.com/revize/dupage/Supervisor%20of%20Assessments/Documents/Other%20Documents/PTAX1080.pdf"><span>PTELL</span></a>, taxes levied to pay this
non-referendum bond debt is limited to what’s known as a Debt Service
Extension Base. Annual increases to that base, like other annual property tax
increases, is limited to 5% or the increase in the consumer price index,
whichever is less. To exceed those limitations, officials seek voter approval.</p>

<p>During the period analyzed, two school districts &nbsp;sought
to increase tax levies by a total of $5.2 million to pay bond debt. In the 2022
primary , Lindop School District 92 in Broadview asked voters to establish a debt
extension base at $425,000, <span><a href="https://www.vfpress.news/articles/education/lindop-laying-groundwork-for-6m-bond-referendum/"><span>which would allow for $6 million in new bonds</span></a></span>
for school repairs. Later that year, Lemont High School District 210 asked
voters in the general election to increase the debt service extension base from
$249,601 to $5 million, an increase of $4.75 million. Voters approved b.</p>

<h2>Approve or Eliminate Home Rule Powers</h2>

<p>Cities and villages with populations of 25,000 or more
automatically possess home rule powers, which allow them to enact an array of
taxes, issue additional debt and exceed property tax limitations. Less populace
&nbsp;municipalities can possess those same powers if voters approve, And,
those powers can also be taken away &nbsp;through referendums.</p>

<p>During the period analyzed, &nbsp;10 municipalities asked
voters for &nbsp;home rule powers. The populations of Harvey and Melrose Park dropped
&nbsp;below 25,000, so both municipalities were required to ask voters in 2022 if
they should lose their home rule status.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><span class="footnote-reference"><span class="footnote-reference"><span>[9]</span></span></span></a>
Voters &nbsp;in Harvey and Melrose Park said they should keep their &nbsp;home
rule taxing powers.</p>

<p>The other eight sought home rule powers. Out of those, voters
in Barrington, Hometown, and Matteson agreed to give their government leaders
new powers Hometown’s home rule referendum passed by only two votes, the closest
vote of any referendum during the period studied.</p>

<h2>Create or Dissolve Taxing Districts</h2>

<p>In order to create or &nbsp;to get rid of a taxing district,
&nbsp;say a park district or fire protection district, a majority of &nbsp;voters
must approve . Creating a new taxing district typically results in new property
taxes.</p>

<p>The village of University Park, sought &nbsp;to create a park
district. Village leaders v asked voters to approve the district with an annual
tax levy no greater than $800,000. It &nbsp;failed because only 50% voted yes in
&nbsp;Cook and Will counties. In Illinois, a majority of voters must approve in
order to create a park district.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><span class="footnote-reference"><span class="footnote-reference"><span>[10]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p>Governments also can create boards to raise taxes &nbsp;&nbsp;to
provide mental health care services. Governments in the suburbs must get voter
approval to establish mental health boards and to levy an additional tax no
greater than 0.15%.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><span class="footnote-reference"><span class="footnote-reference"><span>[11]</span></span></span></a>
Such a &nbsp;referendum may be initiated by government officials through a
resolution or by citizens through a petition.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><span class="footnote-reference"><span class="footnote-reference"><span>[12]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p>Three Cook County townships asked voters to agree to new
taxes &nbsp;to provide community mental health facilities and services . Voters
in Schaumburg and Wheeling townships approved their referendums &nbsp;and voters
in Thornton Township defeated the proposal.</p>

<p>However, the results were challenged due to <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2023/08/29/mental-health-funding-may-be-jeopardized-by-faulty-tax-referendums-in-suburbs/">concerns</a>
&nbsp;the referendums’ language did not meet state requirements and
include the true monetary impact of the tax. In fall 2023, state lawmakers subsequently
allowed the townships to levy the tax without going back to voters with a new
referendum. As of early 2024, officials in Wheeling Township <a href="https://www.dailyherald.com/20240129/news/wheeling-township-still-refusing-to-levy-tax-for-mental-health-board/">remain
concerned</a> over legal challenges and have yet to agree on imposing the new
tax on property owners , while Schaumburg Township is moving ahead with the new
taxes.</p>

<p>In Chicago, Expanded Mental Health Services Programs can be
created within community areas. These programs expand mental health services
for a designated territory<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><span class="footnote-reference"><span class="footnote-reference"><span>[13]</span></span></span></a>
by levying an additional property tax rate of 0.025% to 0.044%. Voters must
approve these programs &nbsp;in a governmental referendum &nbsp;or by a citizen
petition.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"><span class="footnote-reference"><span class="footnote-reference"><span>[14]</span></span></span></a>
Voters are asked to approve two separate questions — one to approve the
tax rate<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15"><span class="footnote-reference"><span class="footnote-reference"><span>[15]</span></span></span></a>
and the other to establish the maximum levy.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"><span class="footnote-reference"><span class="footnote-reference"><span>[16]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p>During the period analyzed, 11 community areas voted to
establish three Expanded Mental Health Programs. In Chicago, &nbsp;political
coalitions for years have stressed the need for additional mental health
services. All six Chicago referendums passed by overwhelming margins of 76% or
more.</p>

<h2>Enact or Increase a Real Estate Transfer Tax</h2>

<p>A real estate transfer tax imposes a tax on &nbsp;property sales
equal to a percentage of the sale price. If government officials want to enact
or increase the real estate transfer tax, they must get voters’ support.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17"><span class="footnote-reference"><span class="footnote-reference"><span>[17]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p>Change to an existing real estate transfer tax was up for a vote
once during the period analyzed. Oak Lawn officials in 2022 asked voters to <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/daily-southtown/ct-sta-oak-lawn-transfer-tax-st-0818-20220816-ynmcbq3ntbh3bhcdjmn5ubaxcm-story.html" target="_blank"><span>close a loophole</span></a> in the &nbsp;existing
real estate transfer tax. Commercial owners avoided paying the tax &nbsp;through
transfer of controlling interests of real estate, like the sale of shares of
stock in a corporation. The referendum failed with 70% of voters voting against
it.</p>

<h1>Results and Findings</h1>

<p>Voter turnout for the referendums &nbsp;averaged &nbsp;32%.
The 2020 Presidential race &nbsp;was the only election where &nbsp;more than half
of registered voters went to the polls.</p>

<p>Average turnout for property tax referendums in the six
elections analyzed fell just under 32%. Turnout was even lower for consolidated
and primary elections, with average turnouts of 19% and 26%.</p>

<p>The April 2021 consolidated election had the lowest average
turnout, when just 15% of those registered cast a vote in seven referendums. Three
passed, including support for &nbsp;bond issues for the Glencoe Park District, with
just 12.5% of voters participating, and the northwest suburban Palatine Rural
Fire Protection District, where only &nbsp;5.6% of registered voters decided
the outcome.</p>

<p>General elections, on the other hand, saw the highest turnout
for referendums. The 2020 presidential election had an average referendum turnout
of 64% — the only election where more than 50% of registered voters decide
a referendum’s fate.</p>

<h2>Low turnout means a minority of taxpayers are making decisions on debt and
tax increases.</h2>

<p>Voters in most cases are failing to turn out for questions
designed to ensure local taxpayers have a say in how schools, libraries, parks,
fire districts and other local governments incur debt or increase annual tax
levies above state-imposed limits. On average, less than a third of registered
voters in Cook County cast a vote for issuing bonds, increasing taxes to pay
for non-referendum debt, or exceeding tax levy caps. </p>

<p>In the most extreme example, only 4% of registered voters in
the Long Grove Fire Protection District approved a $16.5 million bond that
helped finance a new fire station, the lowest turnout for any<i> </i>referendums
during the four-year period. &nbsp;Although there were more than 18,000 registered
voters , only 798.</p>

<p>Low turnout means a few votes decide the outcome. In the
2022 primary election, Arlington Heights School District 25 asked voters to
approve a $75 million bond to repair school buildings and to construct
additional classrooms for full-day kindergarten. With 28% of those registered actually
&nbsp;voting, the referendum passed by less than 0.5 percentage points —
one of the lowest margins for of referendums analyzed.</p>

<h2>Not all referendums &nbsp;lead to higher taxes</h2>

<p>Although a majority of referendum sought tax increases, some
led to savings. Two referendums in 2020 asked voters to dissolve various
departments and taxing districts, in part to lower government costs.</p>

<p>Five taxing districts said &nbsp;approval of their referendums
would not mean &nbsp;higher property tax bills because other existing government
debt was expiring. What officials did not &nbsp;emphasize is that without the
new tax measures, property owners would see even greater decreases in their taxes.
All five referendums passed.</p>

<p>That was the case for the county’s largest bond approved
during the period analyzed. In the April 2023 consolidated election, voters authorized
&nbsp;$179 million in bonds to be issued for Elgin School District 46 by a
margin of more than 25 percentage points — with just 13% of voters casting
a vote. </p>

<p>That additional debt, which officials said would be used to
rebuild five elementary schools, did not increase the school district’s
tax levy, as the new bond replaces retiring debt. However, if voters rejected
the proposal, the district’s annual debt service levy <span><a href="http://www.examinerpublications.com/index.php?m=299&amp;s=0&amp;d=1326&amp;ds=75"><span>would have dropped</span></a></span>
from about $30 million to $20 million in 2024 and between $15 to $17 million from
2025-2032.</p>

<p>Local officials made similar arguments &nbsp;when they asked
voters to exceed tax limits for non-referendum bond debt under PTELL. Both
Lindop School District 92 and Lemont High School District 210 assured voters
increasing the debt service extension base would have zero impact on their tax
burden.</p>

<p>Instead, the increases would allow the school districts to
maintain the amount of debt payments once current debt is paid off. The
district would then use the increased debt capacity to fund additional projects.
However, similar to the bond approvals, the tax burden would eventually decrease
if voters rejected the referendums.</p>

<h2>One thing is clear: most Cook County referendums are decided by a few &nbsp;voters</h2>

<p>Referendums were more likely to pass during primaries. The
combination of low turnout, the focus of voters on state and federal issues and
a motivated &nbsp;group of voters supporting the referendums might explain why
referendums were more likely to pass during primaries.</p>

<p>Other factors also play a role in whether a referendum
succeeds or fails, which makes each unique, that it’s difficult to draw &nbsp;general
conclusions. What is clear is that low voter turnout a minority of highly
engaged voters are making these decisions for their communities.</p>
