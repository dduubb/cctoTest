</span></span>Property taxes across Cook County rose more than $909 million to
$17.6 billion &#8212; an annual increase of 5.4%, which was below the 8% rate
of inflation for 2022.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

</span></span>The total taxes homeowners must pay is up $599.1 million, accounting
for about two-thirds of the overall tax increase. Commercial properties &#8212;
businesses, hotels, office complexes, industries and large apartment complexes &#8212;
are picking up an extra $314.4 million, about a third of the increase.<a

</span></span>Taxes for more than 94,000 commercial properties increased, while
more than 22,000 decreased.</p>

<h2>The Recapture Provision</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>A relatively new provision in the Illinois tax code that
allows school districts and many local governments to recover, or
&#8220;recapture,&#8221; money refunded to property owners who successfully appealed
their taxes the previous year led to an additional $203.7 million being tacked
onto bills. &nbsp;That&#8217;s $72.7 million more than was added to property
owners&#8217; tax bills last year when the law took effect.</p>

<h2>The TIF Effect</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reassessments of all properties in the north and northwest
suburbs, and higher tax rates in Chicago, resulted in tens of millions of extra
dollars flowing into Tax Increment Finance districts, special taxing districts created
to spur economic development in distressed or moribund areas. Little of that
extra money did anything to relieve the overall burden on homeowners because
nearly all of it is channeled into special funds that do not pay for
traditional government services such as police officers&#8217; salaries and school
operations. </p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Cook County Treasurer&#8217;s analysis reveals how fresh
assessments in the north and northwest suburbs shifted more of the overall tax
burden there from businesses onto homeowners as overall taxes grew by 6.4%,
mostly because of increases in the amount of money sought by local taxing
districts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The analysis also shows how steep increases in Chicago
property tax levies &#8212; the total amount of money sought by government taxing
districts &#8212; and the recapture provision pushed up the overall tax burden in
the city by 5.3%. Commercial property owners absorbed the bulk of that
increase. Taxes in the south and southwest suburbs grew by 4.4%.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The total amount billed countywide for 2022 &#8212; which
property owners have to pay this year &#8212; is more than $17.6 billion.
That&#8217;s an increase of more than $909.4 million, or 5.4%, over 2021. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is at least the 29th overall consecutive annual property
tax increase in Cook County, according to data archived by the
Treasurer&#8217;s Office. After adjusting for inflation, the property tax
burden has grown by 37.9% over that time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=624 height=325 id="Graphic 4"
src="DRAFT%202022%20Tax%20Year%20Bill%20Analysis%2010-24-23_files/image001.png">The
countywide $909.4 million increase breaks down regionally as follows: Chicago
&#8212; $410.4 million, a 5.3% increase; suburban property north of North
Avenue &#8212; $331 million, or 6.4% more; suburban property south of North
Avenue &#8212; $173 million, or 4.4% more.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Homeowners across the county would pay a total of about $599.1
million more in taxes than last year, while owners of businesses, industries
and large apartment complexes &#8212; categorized in this analysis as
commercial properties &#8212; would pay $314.4 million more.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That, however, does not mean all homeowners and commercial
property owners owe more. Every property is treated differently by the tax
system, depending on many factors that include: </p>

alt="How Property Taxes are Determined&#13;&#10;&#9642;	School districts, municipalities, park districts and other local governments set the levy, or the overall amount of taxes to be collected to pay for their operations.&#13;&#10;&#9642;	The Assessor estimates the value of properties, and sets homeowner exemptions, which are then used to determine what portion of the overall tax bill each property owner pays.&#13;&#10;&#9642;	The Clerk determines the tax rates, based on the levies and overall assessed value in each local government. The assessed value, multiplied by the rate, needs to equal the total levy.&#13;&#10;&#9642;	The Treasurer sends out the bills, collects the money and distributes it to the local governments that set the levies in the first place.&#13;&#10;">Each
tax bill also depends on a number of other factors: the state of the
hyper-local economy; changes to properties; and the neighborhood housing market.</p>

<h1>The Reassessments</h1>

</div>

<h2>North and Northwest</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Assessor revalued all north and northwest suburban properties,
which affected this year&#8217;s tax bills.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Property assessments are the key component in determining
individual tax bills, because they determine what portion of the total levy each
property owner must pay.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The overall assessed value of residential properties, after
appeals were completed, rose at much higher percentages than the values of
commercial properties in the north and northwest suburbs. That means a chunk of
the overall burden was shifted to homeowners from commercial properties. As a
result, more homeowners than not will owe more in taxes, while more commercial
property owners than not will owe less.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some homeowners will face steep increases, given that the
median residential tax bill in the north and northwest suburbs grew by $952 to
$7,008, a jump of 15.7%<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Cambria",serif'>[4]</span></span></span></a>
&#8212; far and away the biggest percentage increase in the past 30 years,
according to Treasurer&#8217;s Office data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How much a homeowner owes in taxes depends on the suburb and
school district in which their home resides; homeowners living in areas where
the municipality, school district or both significantly increased their levies
will typically be hit with higher increases than homes in areas where the
levies held steady.</p>

<h2>City of Chicago</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=288 height=367
src="DRAFT%202022%20Tax%20Year%20Bill%20Analysis%2010-24-23_files/image003.png"
align=left hspace=12>Although not all properties in Chicago were reassessed for
the 2022 tax bill, some large commercial properties were, increasing their
overall burden. Still, the biggest hit, which affects nearly all property owners,
came from tax increases the Chicago Public Schools and the city of Chicago previously
had approved that totaled nearly $387.6 million.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The CPS levy &#8212; the amount to be collected as approved
by the Chicago Board of Education &#8212; increased by $311.1 million for the 2022-2023
school year, although much of that increase will be paid by <a
href="https://www.cps.edu/about/finance/budget/budget-2023/revenue/#a_other-property-tax-considerations">owners
of newly constructed properties</a> with no impact on other property owners. &nbsp;Some
of that CPS increase also comes from refunds made by two city TIF districts, as
required under Illinois law<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Cambria",serif'>[5]</span></span></span></a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=288 height=367
src="DRAFT%202022%20Tax%20Year%20Bill%20Analysis%2010-24-23_files/image004.png"
align=left hspace=12>The city approved a property tax increase of <a
href="https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/obm/supp_info/2022Budget/2022OverviewFINAL.pdf"><span
style='line-height:107%'>$76.5 million for the 2022 budget year</span></a>.
Both the city and CPS tax increases show up on this year&#8217;s bills.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The median amount of taxes a Chicago homeowner must pay now
stands at $3,704, a 3% increase from the previous year, while the median tax a commercial
property owner owes rose nearly 3.1% to $11,843.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This year&#8217;s bills reveal how a state law that took
effect last year continued to push up property taxes in Chicago and its suburbs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The law, a &#8220;recapture&#8221; provision in the
state&#8217;s property tax code, allows many local governments to recover last
year&#8217;s refunded taxes from previous overassessments that were adjusted
through appeals filed after the bills were first paid. The amount recaptured by
CPS alone for the 2022 tax year was $50.8 million.</p>

<h1>The Recapture Increases</h1>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=340 height=276
src="DRAFT%202022%20Tax%20Year%20Bill%20Analysis%2010-24-23_files/image005.png"
align=left hspace=12>A significant portion of the overall tax increase is due
to a <a href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/102/102-0519.htm"><span
style='line-height:107%'>state law</span></a><span class=MsoHyperlink>, meant
to correct government taxing errors, </span>that took effect in the 2021 tax
year. As a result of the recapture provision, an additional $203.7 million was
added to tax bills across the county.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That&#8217;s $72.7 million more than was added last year.&nbsp;
The higher recapture amount accounts for about 8% of this year&#8217;s
countywide increase. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The recapture law was designed to allow school districts,
park districts and other local agencies to recover the money they repaid to
taxpayers who had their assessments lowered by the Illinois Property Tax Appeal
Board, state courts or county offices.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Cambria",serif'>[6]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In those cases, the money came out of taxing
districts&#8217; bank accounts, reducing the amount of money they thought they
had to pay their bills. Sometimes, when refunds were large, that crimped their
ability to provide key services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When those refunds are made to schools and other taxing
agencies whose authority to increase taxes is limited by state law, the county Clerk
is required to increase their levies the following year by the amount they
refunded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As a result, some taxing districts <a

<p class=MsoNormal>Although the recapture law makes school districts and other taxing
agencies whole, it also adds additional annual burdens on taxpayers.</p>

<div style='border:none;border-bottom:solid #4472C4 1.5pt;padding:0in 0in 1.0pt 0in'>

<h1>Levy Increases</h1>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>More than any other factor that drives up property taxes is the
amount of money levied by each of the county&#8217;s governmental units, such
as schools, village and city halls, libraries and fire districts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Out of 940 taxing agencies<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Cambria",serif'>[7]</span></span></span></a>
in Cook County, 676 &#8212; or 71.9% &#8212; increased levies, according to an
analysis of Cook County Clerk data. Levies can increase for three reasons: agencies
request more money to pay for services; new properties are built that generate additional
tax revenue; and money is recaptured from prior mistaken assessments. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>School districts increased their levies the most in terms of
dollar amounts. Overall, they sought $572.9 million more in 2022, a 6.1%
increase<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Cambria",serif'>[8]</span></span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Under state law, schools can raise taxes by the prior
year&#8217;s increase in the consumer price index, or by 5%, whichever is less.<a
href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Cambria",serif'>[9]</span></span></span></a> Because the CPI rose
7% in 2021, school districts could raise taxes by 5% &#8212; unless voters
agree to exceed those limits in a referendum. In actuality, the overall
percentage increase was higher than 5% after taxes on new properties, recaptured
taxes, bond payment allocations and higher annual increases authorized through
referendums were added.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Municipal governments had the second-highest overall tax increase
in 2022. All together, they increased taxes by $92.8 million, or about 3.2%.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The third-highest dollar amount came from Cook County
government, where voters last November approved a tax increase for the
county&#8217;s forest. The county also benefited from taxing new properties. Those
factors combined led to an overall Cook County government increase of $60
million, or 6.8%.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span

<h1>The TIF Effect</h1>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>Throughout Cook County, the amount owed to TIF districts was
$1.6 billion &#8212; an increase of $124.6 million, according to a
Treasurer&#8217;s Office analysis.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Cambria",serif'>[11]</span></span></span></a>
About 13.7% of the overall&nbsp; tax increase will go directly into more than
400 TIF districts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although commercial property owners will pay the bulk of
that money, homeowners largely will not benefit. That&#8217;s because nearly
all of the money is used to reimburse developers in those districts for a
portion of their costs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Only a small portion of taxes collected in TIF districts goes
to local taxing bodies.&nbsp; That can happen under three scenarios: when TIF money
is declared surplus, which is then distributed to taxing districts; when TIF
money is used to build schools or other infrastructures; or when an underlying
agreement in a TIF district provides for returning a slice of the money to
taxing districts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Chicago&#8217;s two transit TIFs, used to match federal
funding for CTA improvements, all the money that would have gone to CPS is
returned to the district. In addition, 20% of the money that would have gone to
all other government agencies is returned to those agencies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In TIF districts, which are controlled by municipal
governments and typically last for 23 years, additional taxes collected as a
result of increases in assessments are funneled into those districts until they
are closed. Critics say TIF districts divert badly needed money from schools,
municipalities and other local governments, forcing those agencies to increase
taxes. Proponents counter that the revenue might never have existed in the
first place without TIF districts, which they argue increase the overall tax
base and create jobs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The biggest increase was in Chicago. There, an additional
$86.7 million is being billed for TIF districts, bringing the total annual amount
of money flowing into these special taxing districts to nearly $1.2 billion. In
the north and northwest suburbs, an additional $18.7 million is expected to
flow into TIF districts, for a total of $194.8. And in the south and southwest
suburbs, an additional $19.2 million is being billed for TIF districts, for a
total of about $203 million.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although the overall amount of money billed by TIF districts
across the county is up 8.7%, some TIF districts billed less this year.
That&#8217;s because how much of what&#8217;s billed in each of the 439 TIF
districts depends on what happens to the assessed values of properties within
each district. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Chicago, 43 of 126 TIF districts expect to collect less money
this year. The transit TIF to improve the CTA&#8217;s Red and Purple lines saw
the biggest drop &#8212; down $3 million to $69.4 million, although it&#8217;s
still one of the city&#8217;s most lucrative TIF districts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The biggest gain was in the <a
href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/dcd/supp_info/tif/kinzie_industrialcorridortif.html"><span
style='line-height:107%'>Chicago-Kinzie Conservation TIF</span></a><span
class=MsoHyperlink> District,</span> which lies northwest of the Kennedy and
Eisenhower expressways in a booming part of the city. That TIF &#8212; which was
due to expire at the end of 2022 but was extended another 12 years &#8212; billed
$37.1 million more for a total of nearly $134.2 million.<a href="#_ftn12"
name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Cambria",serif'>[12]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next-biggest gain occurred in the <a
href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/dcd/supp_info/tif/canal_congress_tif.html"><span
style='line-height:107%'>Canal/Congress TIF</span></a> District. That district,
just west of the Chicago River&#8217;s South Branch between Harrison Street and
Warren Avenue, includes the renovated Old Chicago Main Post Office, which
straddles the Eisenhower Expressway just east of Canal Street. The amount
billed in that TIF district grew by nearly $17.9 million to about $65.1
million.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the north and northwest suburbs, 25 of 91 TIFs billed
less this year. The biggest drops occurred in the <a
href="https://www.villageofschaumburg.com/government/economic-development/tax-increment-financing-tif"><span
style='line-height:107%'>North Schaumburg TIF</span></a> District, location of
the former Motorola campus, and in the Rolling Meadows Golf Road Conservation
TIF District, which was created to help relocate the headquarters of insurance
firm Arthur J. Gallagher &amp; Co.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Schaumburg TIF District is billing about $3.4 million
less, but still plans to collect $16.2 million, and the Rolling Meadows TIF
District is down about $3.4 million to about $571,000. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The biggest gain in the north and northwest suburbs occurred
in Elk Grove&#8217;s <a
href="https://www.elkgrove.org/business/business-development/village-tif-districts"><span
style='line-height:107%'>Busse/Elmhurst Road TIF</span></a> District, set up to
upgrade an aging 921-acre business park. That TIF district is billing $8.5
million more this year, for a total of nearly $36.3 million.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the south and southwest suburbs, 80 of 222 TIF districts
billed less this year. The biggest drop occurred in Country Club Hill&#8217;s 175<sup>th</sup>/Cicero
TIF District near the intersection of Interstate 80 and 175<sup>th</sup>
Street, which billed nearly $11.2 million less this year, bringing its
anticipated revenue down to just a bit more than $438,000. That precipitous
drop resulted after appeals of assessed values on properties owned by <a
href="https://rejournals.com/logistics-property-co-acquires-102-acres-in-country-club-hills-illinois/"><span
style='line-height:107%'>Logistics Property Co.</span></a> dramatically lowered
the estimated value of its buildings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The biggest billing gain in the south and southwest suburbs
is in Markham&#8217;s Interstate Crossing TIF District, home to an Amazon
fulfillment center that opened in October 2021. The amount billed in that TIF
District grew by about $19.6 million, to more than $20 million. That district alone
accounted for the vast majority of the TIF district billing gain in the south
and southwest suburbs.</p>

<h1>Commercial to Residential Shift</h1>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the north and northwest suburbs, reassessments shifted
more of the tax burden onto homeowners from commercial properties &#8212;
partly reversing the effects of reassessments done three years earlier.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The shift occurred after the Cook County Board of Review
shaved nearly 20% off the total assessed value of commercial and industrial
properties set by the Assessor&#8217;s Office. At the same time, the Board of
Review reduced by less than 2% the total value of residential properties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Had the Assessor&#8217;s values not been overturned, about
1% of the tax burden would have shifted from homeowners to commercial
properties, the Treasurer&#8217;s Office analysis shows. When the Board of
Review&#8217;s work was finished, about 3% of the burden shifted from
commercial properties to homes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When owners of commercial or industrial properties appeal
their assessments, they must submit more information about their properties and
their income than the assessor typically has access to. In addition, the two
agencies for years have differed over how to account for the effects of
property tax burdens on commercial and industrial property values. The two
agencies largely do see eye to eye on residential assessments, which are
simpler to estimate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That plays out in the final decisions by the Board of Review.
The Board of Review lowered the values of 11,025 commercial and industrial
properties &#8212; two thirds of the 16,837 that were appealed. But it only
reduced the values of 66,474 residential properties, just a bit more than a
third of the 200,693 that appealed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Residential values also rose more than they might otherwise
have because this tax year&#8217;s initial round of assessments reversed the
COVID-related adjustments the Assessor made in 2020. Those adjustments lowered
the values of residential properties by an average of 9.9%.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Contrary to the expectations of the Assessor&#8217;s Office,
home values actually rose during the pandemic. As a result, the new
reassessments significantly increased the estimated values of homes in the
north and northwest suburbs. The assessed value of homes rose by nearly $3.3
billion, or 27.8%, while commercial values rose by about $767.8 million, or 11.4%.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is important to understand that commercial and industrial
properties in Cook County are assessed for property tax purposes at 25% of
their estimated market value, while homes and apartment buildings are assessed
at 10%. In addition, homes occupied by their owners can take exemptions that
remove a portion of their assessed value from tax calculations. As a result, the
owner of a commercial or industrial property with the identical market value to
a home pays at least two-and-a-half times more in taxes than the owner of an identically
valued home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Chicago, that has led to some sharp differences between
residential and commercial properties. The average effective tax rate &#8212;
the percentage of a property&#8217;s estimated value paid in property taxes
each year &#8212; on a median-value, owner-occupied Chicago home in 2022 was about
1.5%, <a
href="https://www.lincolninst.edu/publications/other/50-state-property-tax-comparison-study-2022"><span
style='line-height:107%'>according to a study</span></a> by the Lincoln
Institute of Land Policy and the Minnesota Center for Fiscal Excellence. That
is just one-fifth of a percentage point higher than the average among 53 populous
U.S. cities measured in the study.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But the effective tax rate on commercial properties in
Chicago was about 4%, making it the highest among the 53 cities and more than
twice the average of 1.84%. Industrial properties in the city had an effective
tax rate of about 2.4%, compared to an average of about 1.4%, according to the Lincoln
Institute/Minnesota Center study. Apartments, meanwhile, had an effective tax
rate of 1.6%, a fraction of a percentage above the average.</p>

<h1>Commercial Reassessments in the City</h1>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although Chicago wasn&#8217;t slated for a complete
reassessment this year, the Assessor&#8217;s Office <a
href="https://www.cookcountyassessor.com/news/assessors-office-resets-values-559-commercial-properties-chicago"><span
style='line-height:107%'>restored the higher values of 213 commercial
properties</span></a> in and around the Central Business District after the
Board of Review &#8212; which considers appeals of property tax assessments
&#8212; significantly lowered their values in 2022.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although the Assessor&#8217;s Office increased the values on
the 213 properties (represented by 559 separate property index numbers) by more
nearly $1.1 billion<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Cambria",serif'>[13]</span></span></span></a>,
the Board of Review subsequently lowered that by more than $973 million. The final
increase in assessed values on those properties still was about $145.2 million,
which somewhat eased the burden on residential properties in the city.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In addition, new commercial properties, assessments lowered on
residential properties and increased reassessments of upgraded commercial
properties can lead to a bigger tax burden on commercial properties. This year,
all of those factors played a role in shifting more than 1% of the overall
Chicago tax burden onto businesses from homeowners.</p>

<div style='border:none;border-bottom:solid #4472C4 1.5pt;padding:0in 0in 1.0pt 0in'>

<h1>North and Northwest Suburbs</h1>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the suburbs north of North Avenue, where properties were
reassessed for this year&#8217;s bills, more than 3% of the overall tax burden
was shifted to residences from commercial properties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Indeed, taxes on residential properties in this area shot up
while they declined on commercial properties. Overall, taxes rose by a total of
$330 million to nearly $5.4 billion &#8212; with a $380 million, or 12.9%,
increase on residences and a $50 million, or 2.7%, decrease on commercial
properties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That is not to say all homeowners will pay more in taxes or
that all commercial properties will pay less. While taxes for more than 318,000
homeowners went up, nearly 92,000 saw their bills go down. And while taxes for
nearly 14,400 commercial properties decreased, about 6,400 increased.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The median residential tax bill for all properties grew by 15.7%
to $7,008, while the median commercial bill increased by 2.2% to $29,623.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The highest-percentage increases in median residential bills
occurred in parts of two municipalities that straddle North Avenue in the
western suburbs. That&#8217;s because homes north of North Avenue in those
communities were reassessed at higher levels, while the homes south of the
dividing line won&#8217;t have new, higher values applied to tax bills until
next year &#8212; pushing more of the overall tax burden on their neighbors in
the north of town.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the smaller portion of Melrose Park north of North
Avenue, the median bill on 221 homes grew by 45.8% to $6,909. That occurred
even though the median residential bill throughout the entire village &#8212;
where there are 4,969 homes south of North Avenue &#8212; grew by just 3.3% to
$4,761. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Northlake, the median bill for 2,866 homes north of North
Avenue jumped 37.3% to $6,384 &#8212; while the median bill for the 612 homes
south of the dividing line dropped by 4.8% to $5,084. Part of the increase
north of the dividing line is the result of an increase of more than 10% in
taxes sought by taxing districts in that city.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The largest median increase in residential tax bills for a
suburb entirely situated north of the assessment dividing line was in Rosemont,
a suburb near O&#8217;Hare International Airport, In Rosemont, median
residential taxes grew by 32.5% to $7,222 &#8212; driven by a shift of part of
the tax base from commercial to residential properties because of reassessments.
But officials in Rosemont, an entertainment hub dominated by commercial uses,
typically rebate a significant portion of property taxes to homeowners.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next two highest increases occurred in Schiller Park,
where the median tax grew by 29.7% to $6,387, and in Des Plaines, where it grew
by 28.7% to $6,067. Overall, taxes billed in Schiller Park grew by 8.4% and in
Des Plaines by 6.9%.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Other suburbs that saw their median bill increase by more
than 20% include Franklin Park (26.9% to $6,021); the portion of Deer Park in Cook
County (24.7% to $5,778) where there are just 10 homes; Elk Grove Village (24.4%
to $6,250); River Grove (23.2% to $6,524), the portion of Elgin in Cook County
(21.8% to $5,197) where there are 6,980 homes; Rolling Meadows (21.2% to
$6,040); Lincolnwood (20.8% to $8,949); and Harwood Heights (20.4% to $6,299).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In addition to a general shift in the tax burden from
commercial to residential properties, high median bill increases in four
communities also were driven by significant increases in the amounts taxed: Elk
Grove taxes were up by 9%; River Grove&#8217;s taxes were up by 8.6%;
Lincolnwood&#8217;s taxes went up by 6.2%; and Harwood Heights rose by 8.6%.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Discerning a clear pattern in the effect of reassessments on
median commercial tax bills in the north/northwest suburbs is more complicated than
it is for residential properties. That is for three reasons: from one year to
the next, the number of businesses in a municipality can significantly change;
the market forces affecting commercial assessments, which are partly based on
income, are different for different types of businesses &#8212; particularly in
the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic; and the Assessor&#8217;s Office decision to
change the classification of rental condos from commercial to residential
skewed the median tax data for large apartment complexes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nevertheless, the commercial data shows an overall trend:
median taxes for commercial properties decreased in most suburbs, in many cases
by 15% or more, in a way that cannot be explained alone by the rental condo
classification change.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For a detailed breakdown, see the data section of this
report.</p>

<h1>South and Southwest Suburbs</h1>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the suburbs south of North Avenue, which now are being
reassessed for next year&#8217;s bills, overall taxes rose $180 million &#8212;
with a $100 million, or 4.1%, increase on residential properties and an $80
million, or 5.1%, increase on commercial properties. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>More than 338,000 homeowners had higher bills, while about 90,500
have to pay less. Taxes for nearly 29,000 commercial properties increased,
while taxes for about 3,500 went down. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The median tax on a residential property in the south and
southwest suburbs grew by 3.9% to $5,103, while the median commercial bill increased
by 2% to $15,608. Although homeowners might not like that trend, struggling
commercial enterprises in the south suburbs may find some small measure of
comfort.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There were five suburbs in which median residential bills
increased by 10% or more: The Cook County portion of Steger, up 13.4% to
$1,455; Chicago Ridge, up 12.8% to $3,459; Robbins, up 11.8% to $1,481; Palos
Hills, up 10.1% to $4,078; and Markham,<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Cambria",serif'>[14]</span></span></span></a>
up 10.1% to $2,393.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And there were four suburbs where median commercial tax
bills increased by more than 10%: Indian Head Park, up 16.2% to $20,022; the
Cook County portion of Steger, up 14.3% to $2,611; Hazel Crest, up 12.2% to
$16,312; and Westchester, up 12% to $9,099.</p>

<h1>City of Chicago</h1>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>Significant increases in City Hall and Chicago Public
Schools&#8217; levies approved under a prior mayor, the recapture provision and
higher TIF district bills boosted the overall property tax burden in Chicago by
$410 million &#8212; with a $290 million, or 7.7%, increase on commercial
properties and a $120 million, or 3%, increase on residential properties</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Taxes for more than 627,000 residential properties
increased, while taxes for more than 91,000 went down. More than 59,000
commercial property owners had higher bills, while fewer than 4,500 owe less.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The median tax on a residential property in Chicago grew by nearly
3% to $3,704, while the median commercial bill increased by about 3.1% to
$11,843.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For commercial properties, the effects were uneven. Although
both non-industrial commercial properties and large apartment complexes saw
their median bills increase by more than 4%, the median bill on industrial
properties dropped by a fraction of a percentage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There were five community areas where the median commercial
tax bill increased by more than 10%: South Deering, up 13.7% to $8,515;
Ashburn, up 13.2% to $7,753; Burnside, up 13.2% to $7,880; Fuller Park, up
11.8% to $7,044; and East Garfield Park, up 10.6% to $4,814. All are on the
South Side, except East Garfield Park, which is on the West Side.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The billing data does not show the kind of dramatic swings
in residential median tax bills among the city&#8217;s 77 community areas that they
experienced in tax year 2021, when bills first were calculated using new
reassessments. As a result, the Lower West Side Community Area last year saw
its median bill increase by 46%, while three South and West side community
areas saw their median bills decrease by more than 43%, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nevertheless, five South Side communities saw median
residential increases of 6% or more: Fuller Park &#8212; where the median
dropped for tax year 2021 by 46% &#8212; up 10.1% to $999; Avalon Park, up 8.9%
to $1,970; Auburn Gresham, up 8.8% to $1,970; Roseland, up 8.3% to $1,238; and
Englewood &#8212; where the median tax dropped for the previous tax year by 44%
&#8212; up 7.2% to $719. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(To see how residential and commercial tax bills changed in
Chicago, its community areas and wards, as well as each suburb, see the data
section of this study.)</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="_Hlk120455452">About 81% of property owners across
Cook County must pay more in taxes this year compared to last year, meaning
some 1.4 million taxpayers will have to dig deeper into their wallets.</a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>About 17% &#8212; or roughly 304,000 &#8212; will get a
lower tax bill. And about 2%, or more than 34,500, won&#8217;t see any change
in their bills.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The increases are primarily the result of local governments
and school districts raising property tax levies, as well as shifts in the
overall burden borne by homeowners versus commercial property owners. That is
especially true in the north and northwest suburbs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Other factors driving up tax bills include increases in TIF
billing and more money recaptured under state law, which requires that tax
rebates resulting from the previous year&#8217;s assessment appeals be added on
to the levies of non-home rule communities and school districts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The reassessment of the north and northwest suburbs, reversed
prior COVID-19 reductions given by the Assessor. Factoring in a booming housing
market, while commercial properties generally saw significantly lower increases
because of their current economic struggles, homeowners in many of those
suburbs will be hit with some of the biggest tax increases they&#8217;ve seen
in decades.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the same reasons, a majority of north and northwest
suburban businesses are being billed at lower amounts. Elsewhere in the county,
more residential and commercial bills are going up than going down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A silver lining is that government officials in Cook County increased
taxes overall by 5.4% &#8212; less than the costs of many goods and services.
In 2022, the year for which taxes are being billed, the national consumer price
index rose by 8%.</p>
